# M011: architecture decision laboratory

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

Architecture at this scale means assigning responsibilities and avoiding unnecessary synchronization. You do not need a distributed system diagram to make a consequential design choice. A small function boundary, a stable identifier or one CSS owner can determine whether a later change stays understandable.

## Decision review 1: Share behavior, keep values per instance

**Reference rationale:** Placing name on each new object gives each widget independent data. Sharing a method on the prototype avoids confusing behavior ownership with data ownership. The reference does not modify Object.prototype, and the shared function reads the receiver supplied by the call. Compare two function identities as well as two return values: identical output alone would not prove the function is shared.

**Question to resolve:** What changes if you allocate a new function inside every constructor call?

### Write competing proposals

Proposal A is the reference approach. Proposal B must be a plausible alternative, not an obviously broken straw man. Describe what each stores, what each derives, which boundary each validates and where visible feedback occurs. For a static page, describe source order, container/child ownership and content behavior instead of inventing application state.

### Use the same acceptance examples

Run both proposals against the same ordinary case, boundary and future-change scenario. If they produce different behavior, decide whether the difference is permitted by the contract. If both satisfy the contract, compare the number of facts a maintainer must keep synchronized and the amount of unrelated work needed for the next feature.

| Criterion | Reference proposal | Alternative proposal | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meets current user contract | Fill in | Fill in | One discriminating example |
| Owns each fact in one place | Fill in | Fill in | Source or state diagram |
| Handles failure or missing input | Fill in | Fill in | Error/recovery sequence |
| Supports the next small story | Fill in | Fill in | Proposed bounded diff |

### Record the decision with a reversal condition

Write: “I choose A/B because this concrete example shows this cost. I would revisit the choice if this specific requirement appeared.” A reversal condition prevents the decision from becoming a slogan. Do not use a hypothetical million-user future to justify complexity that teaches nothing about the present example.

**Source anchor:** `public/core.js` and `public/app.js`. Inspect the actual dependency direction; a diagram that names layers but cannot identify a call or data flow is incomplete.

## Decision review 2: Show shadowing with an own property

**Reference rationale:** The shadow button assigns a method on A. It leaves the prototype untouched, which is why B continues to describe itself normally. The restore button deletes that single own property. This is an explicit lookup exercise, not a mechanism for patching global language behavior.

**Question to resolve:** Why does assigning undefined fail to restore the inherited method?

## Decision review 3: Fail visibly on a lost receiver

**Reference rationale:** The prototype method checks that its receiver is a Widget. A detached call therefore produces an intentional diagnostic instead of an obscure property-read failure. Calling the same function with .call(a) supplies the missing receiver without creating another widget.

**Question to resolve:** Which expression supplies this in a.describe(), and what supplies it in method.call(a)?

## Avoid accidental scope expansion

A new abstraction should answer a problem you can name in the current code or selected story. If the main benefit is that it looks more professional, ask what specific change becomes easier and what new concepts a junior now has to learn. Keep the reference small enough to trace.

## Transfer the review habit

Where does JavaScript look when this property is absent on the instance?

Use that question to compare this project with its paired curriculum repository. Cite the actual source or guide you inspected; do not claim the other repository uses a pattern merely because its name sounds related. Your comparison may conclude that the shared learning concept appears in a different implementation.
