# M011: foundations clinic

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

Property lookup and receiver selection answer different questions. Lookup finds which function is called; the call expression supplies the receiver whose data that function reads. An own property can block an inherited property even when its value is undefined. Keeping these questions separate makes shadowing, deletion and detached callbacks much easier to predict.

## Start from one visible behavior

Read this contract slowly: Each Widget owns its name while both instances inherit one describe function. Assigning a describe property to A shadows the inherited function without changing B. Deleting that own property reveals the prototype method again. A detached method needs an explicit Widget receiver; the reference reports a readable error when it has none.

Underline the promised result, circle the input boundary and mark the stated limitation. A junior developer often starts by naming a framework or file. Start instead with an observation that a user could confirm or reject. File names become useful after you know which responsibility you are looking for.

## Clinic 1: Own property

An entry stored directly on the instance.

**Small experiment:** Use Object.hasOwn before and after shadowing.

Find the part of `Widget.prototype.describe` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

### Predict before inspecting

Write one ordinary example and one example that makes the distinction matter. Give an expected result for each. The second example should separate two plausible implementations; simply changing a name or color may leave both candidates behaving identically. Explain why your chosen variation is informative.

### Build a tiny explanation

Explain **own property** in three sentences: what problem it names, where you can see it in this repository, and what would go wrong if you ignored it. Avoid replacing the explanation with a slogan such as “best practice.” A concrete input, property or event should appear in at least one sentence.

### Repeat with less support

Close this paragraph, revisit the source and reconstruct the explanation without copying. Then deliberately change one assumption and predict which part of the explanation must change. Record the first point where you become uncertain. That point is a better question for a mentor than asking for another complete tour of the entire project.

**Checkpoint question:** How would you teach this distinction using only the experiment “Use Object.hasOwn before and after shadowing.”? Leave your answer in the session journal before reading the mentor hints.

## Clinic 2: Prototype lookup

Searching shared behavior after no own property is found.

**Small experiment:** Draw the lookup route for describe.

Find the part of `Widget.prototype.describe` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

## Clinic 3: Receiver

The this value supplied for a function call.

**Small experiment:** Compare a.describe with detached describe.call(a).

Find the part of `Widget.prototype.describe` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

## Clinic 4: Shadowing

An own property taking precedence over an inherited one.

**Small experiment:** Explain why deletion and assignment to undefined differ.

Find the part of `Widget.prototype.describe` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward.

## Read a real source window

The following is an excerpt from [public/core.js](../public/core.js), beginning at source line 1. It is a reading window, not a standalone runnable exercise. Open the linked file for surrounding declarations and context.

```js
// Instance data belongs to each widget; behavior lives on the prototype.
export function Widget(name) {
  if (typeof name !== 'string' || !name.trim()) throw new TypeError('A name is required.');
  this.name = name.trim();
}
Widget.prototype.describe = function () {
  if (!(this instanceof Widget)) throw new TypeError('describe needs a Widget receiver.');
  return `Widget: ${this.name}`;
};
export function inspect(widget) {
  return {
    name: widget.name,
    ownsName: Object.hasOwn(widget, 'name'),
    ownsDescribe: Object.hasOwn(widget, 'describe'),
    description: widget.describe(),
  };
}
```

For each meaningful line, label its job as input interpretation, validation, state ownership, transformation, output or presentation. Some files contain only a subset of those jobs. Do not force the categories onto code that does not perform them. A closing brace is structure, not a separate business rule.

Choose one expression and restate it as a question the program answers. Then choose one expression that merely carries out a consequence of that answer. This separates a product decision from mechanical plumbing. If you cannot explain an operator, isolate a tiny example rather than rewriting the whole function.

## A three-column scratch sheet

| Before | Rule or operation | After |
|---|---|---|
| Write an actual supported input or layout situation | Name the owning function, property or event | Predict the concrete result |
| Change one assumption | State which rule now matters | Predict what changes and what remains stable |
| Use an invalid, missing or unsupported case | Identify the boundary that rejects or handles it | Predict feedback and retained state |

Do not fill the After column by running the reference first. That turns prediction practice into transcription. After predicting, observe the program and put discrepancies in a fourth note below the table. A wrong prediction is useful when you can name the mistaken assumption.

## What understanding looks like

You can locate `Widget.prototype.describe`, explain why the adapter has a separate job, and produce a new counterexample without borrowing one from the tests. You can also say what the reference deliberately does not support. If one of those is missing, choose the smallest clinic above that addresses it and repeat that clinic with different data.
